5. TryCatchUpdates
   - from java 7 updates are done in try and catch block.
   - Before java 7, there is no resource auto close.
   - After java 7, resource auto close is added but declaration need to be done locally within the block.
   - Now in java 9, resource auto close is there and also no need to create resource locally, it can be passed as reference from outside the block.
