# List
- Intro
  1. List Interface represents an ordered or sequential collection of objects. 
  2. This interface has some methods which can be used to store and manipulate the ordered collection of objects. 
  3. The classes which implement the List interface are called as Lists. 
  4. ArrayList, Vector and LinkedList are some examples of lists.
- It's classes
  1. ArrayList
     - It is a normal list.
     - ArrayList is same like normal array, but it can grow and shrink dynamically to hold any number of elements. 
     - ArrayList is a sequential collection of objects which increases or decreases in size as we add or delete the elements.
  2. Vector
     - the main difference between ArrayList and Vector is that Vector class is synchronized. 
     - That means, only one thread can enter into vector object at any moment of time.
  3. LinkedList
     - The LinkedList class in Java is an implementation of doubly linked list which can be used both as a List as well as Queue.
     - The LinkedList in java can have any type of elements including null and duplicates. Elements can be inserted and can be removed from both the ends and can be retrieved from any arbitrary position.
